   * Path
   * ----
   *
   * A path is an string that represents a location in a dirty System.
   * A path is composed of path parts:
   *  * A Path Part is expressed by the following regular expression:
   *  [A-Za-z\-\._0-9]+.
   *  * Path Parts are case sensitive: 'hello' and 'Hello' are different
   *  Path parts.
   *
   * A valid path is:
   *  * The root path '/' that represents the topmost of the hierarchy.
   *  * A path that is derived from the root path and appending Path Parts
   *  separated by '/'. Each of the Path Parts that are added are known as
   *  children of the previous path. The previous path is called parent path.
   *
   *
   * If a given nested path exists, after subtracting the last part is should
   * be a valid path too. That means that all the ancestors of a given path
   * exists. For instance, if we have path /a/b/c/d then, /a/b/c, /a/b/, /a/
   * and / must exist.
   * If a path does not have a trailing '/', a '/' is prepended to it.
   *
   * Entry
   * -----
   *
   * An Entry is a data structure with the following keys:
   *
   *  id: identifier provided by the underlying system to uniquely identify a
   *    file or folder. It does not change when a file or folder is moved or
   *    renamed.
   *  name: An string containing the last path part of the full path.
   *  fullpath: The path of the entry that represents it unequivocally.
   *  type: Flag that can be set to 'file' or 'folder' that represents what
   *    kind of entry is.
   *  meta: a key/value repository for contextual information about the file.
   *    standard fields include created, accessed and modified dates.
   *
   *  Examples:
   *
   *  [{
     *    name:       "my.raml",
     *    fullpath:   "/payments-api/my.raml",
     *    type:       "file"
     *  }]
   *
   *  [{
     *    name:       "examples",
     *    fullpath:   "/payments-api/examples",
     *    type:       "folder",
     *    children: [{
     *      name:       "json",
     *      fullpath:   "/payments-api/examples/json",
     *      type:       "folder"
     *      children:   [{
     *        name:       "user.json",
     *        fullpath:   "/payments-api/examples/json/user.json",
     *        type:       "file"
     *      }]
     *    }]
     *   },
   *   {
     *      name:       "xml",
     *      fullpath:   "/payments-api/examples/xml",
     *      type:       "folder"
     *    }]
   *  }]
   *
   * Files
   * -----
   *
   * Content of files is encoded in UTF-8.
